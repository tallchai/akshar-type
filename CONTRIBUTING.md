## GlyphsApp
Akshar was built with GlyphsApp, a popular font development tool.
To contribute, you would need a Mac and a licensed copy of GlyphsApp.

## Building
To build the fonts from the source file, you will need to install [gftools](https://github.com/googlefonts/gftools).
Once you have installed it, run the following:
`gftools builder sources/builder.yaml` from the root of the project.

This should build the font files based on the configuration specified in sources/builder.yaml.
