## Introduction
Akshar is a variable display sans-serif font family that supports Latin and Devanagari.
It is designed for titles, statements, headlines, annoucements, intros, outros, and other display texts.
Akshar (Hindi: अक्षर) literally means an alphabet or a letter in Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati and other Indic languages.

## OpenType Variable
Akshar is an OpenType Variable Font. It offers 2 axes: Weight (`wght`) and Parametric Thin Stroke axis (`YOPQ`).
The **Weight** axis ranges from 300 to 700. The **Parametric Thin Stroke axis** axis ranges from 25 to 100.
Not only does this enable a wide array of display possibilities but also provides performance efficiency
by providing the all the weight variations through a single font file.
