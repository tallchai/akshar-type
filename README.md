# Akshar
Public repo for Akshar Typeface by Tall Chai.

Akshar is a variable display sans-serif font family that supports Latin and Devanagari.
It is designed for titles, statements, headlines, annoucements, intros, outros, and other display texts.
Although display type font families are traditionally more formal and stiff in their approach,
Akshar embraces curves to its characters to add a _human informality_ to its design.

Akshar (Hindi: अक्षर) literally means an alphabet or a letter in Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati and other Indic languages.

Akshar is also the first OpenType Variable Font on Google Fonts to support Devanagari. It offers
every single style on the weight (`wght`) axis between the range 300 to 700.
Not only does this enable a wide array of display possibilities but also provides performance efficiency
by providing the all the weight variations through a single font file.
